# Credit-Card-Analysis
## Project Objectives
Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards to broaden their product offerings and reach in the financial market.

AtliQ Data Services learned about this through an internal link and approached Mitron Bank with a proposal to implement this project. However, the strategy director of Mitron Bank, Mr.Bashnir Rover is skeptical and asked them to do a pilot project with the sample data before handing them the full project. They provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities on their online spending and other details.

You are a data analyst at AtliQ Data Services and were asked by your manager Tony Sharma to take over this project. Your role is to analyze the provided sample data and report key findings to the strategy team of Mitron Bank. This analysis is expected to guide them in tailoring the credit cards to customer needs and market trends.

The successful acquisition of this project depends on your ability to provide actionable, data-driven recommendations and impress Mr. Bashnir Rover & his team.
